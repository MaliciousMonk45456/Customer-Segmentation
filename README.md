# Customer-Segmentation
Applying a softmax based neural network to predict customer category

Using tensorflow to create a custom neural network to carry out multi-class customer classification after data preprocessing like label-encoding and one-hot-encoding and normalisation
Then we optimise the choice of regularisation parameter by comparing loss on validation set and then using the weights trained earlier carrying out inference using custom functions to build a neural network
